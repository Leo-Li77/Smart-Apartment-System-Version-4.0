package com.leoli.Driver;

/**
 * Update (Compared to Version 2.5)
 *  1. Add the SuperDriver Class to store the methods and the arrayList "studentStore".
 *  2. The Driver Class is only used to interact with the user (to show menu and get options from user).
 *  3. Add the option 8 to delete a student from the arrayList "studentStore".

 * Points to Note
 *  1. Check-out Application: It is necessary to check that there are successfully completed accommodation applications before processing the check-out application.
 *  2. Accommodation Transfer Application: It is necessary to check whether there are successfully completed accommodation applications and unsuccessful check-out applications.
 *  3. Item Borrowing Application: Check if the previous item borrowing application was successfully completed.
 *  4. Activity Room Borrowing Application: Check if the previous activity room borrowing application was successfully completed.

 * Final to Note
 *  You can learn more details about the functions of methods and fields by reading the notations I added to the methods.

 *  More details can be seen in README.md.
